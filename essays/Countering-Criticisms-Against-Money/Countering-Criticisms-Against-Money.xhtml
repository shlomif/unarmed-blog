<h1>Countering Criticisms Against Money</h1>

<p>
The aim of this essay is to counter two criticisms I encountered against
the concept of money.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_Nothing_Day">Buy
Nothing Day</a></h2>

<p>
In “Buy Nothing Day” people are encouraged to pass a day without buying
anything using money, but instead exchange “gifts” using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter">barter</a>. The problem with
that is that the invention of money, which is generally agreed to be
convenient, predates more recent and more controversial trends such as
capitalism, commercialism, and consumerism, and its use should not be
discouraged. As someone wrote to me when I mentioned it to him: “Money allows
us to translate dissimilar items into a way in which they can be compared and
traded.  Going back to ‘my Perl code for 100 bales of hay’ is a recipe for
disaster.”.
</p>

<p>
The economy is not perfect, and economists do not agree of the proper way
to fix it, but abolishing money would be a huge step backward.
