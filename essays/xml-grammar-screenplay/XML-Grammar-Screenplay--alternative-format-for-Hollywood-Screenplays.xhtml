<h1>XML-Grammar-Screenplay: Alternative Format for Hollywood Screenplays</h1>

<p>
A short time after I publicised the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/">XML-Grammar-Screenplay</a>
format, a Perl monger sent me a message reading this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I would think that a proper screenplay grammar would be useful (I've thought
of writing one myself). Though I've looked through your screenplay examples, I
can't see any of them, anywhere, which is actually rendered in correct
screenplay format (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Screenplay_example.svg">example</a>),
nor anything which appears to directly support the special directives often
found in screenplays, such as sluglines.  Am I missing something?
</p>

<p>
(Poor) Directions for formatting a screenplay are
<a href="http://www.scriptfrenzy.org/howtoformatascreenplay">here</a>.
That really doesn't cover the *extremely* rigid formatting rules involved (a
reader can often <b>toss</b> a script with <b>bad margins</b> and get paid for it anyway).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Why is it important? Because it seems that with this pedantic and perfectionist
attitude Hollywood has left its original rebellious and
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/insurgent">insurgent</a> roots (the
film production companies were located around to avoid litigation from
Edison’s patent trolling machine; and Henry Ford voiced some anti-semitic
concerns about the Jewish dominance of Hollywood, which he claimed was
part of their conspiracy to take over the world), and became more strict.
How many good films did not take off because of badly formatted or malformed
screenplays? Hard to know.
</p>

<p>
This is why I now think that the format of
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/#demo-screenplay1">Screenplay-Text</a> is
better simply because it is validated to conform with it and is easier to
write (being based on scripts for drama that I read, as well as some
Internet screenplays such as
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/hitchhiker-guide-to-star-trek-tng.html">“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Star Trek - The Next Generation”</a>).
XML-Grammar-Screenplay still has many issues like the fact that its
error messages can be unhelpful, or that it is still lacking many features,
but these should be relatively easy to resolve (possibly by a refactoring
or even partial or complete rewrites).
</p>

<p>
As I note in the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath">“David and Goliath” section</a> of my
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting all the Cards on the Table (2013)”</a>,
a hacker knows the rules, plays by them, but is not afraid to bend them, or
make up his own rules and that is what
<a href="http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/2396.html">an action hero</a> is all
about. So now I'm trying to promote Screenplay-Text and Screenplay-XML
as hackier alternatives to the traditional screenplays of Hollywood which
became more “professional” and tragic hero-like.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, “reality, to be conquered, must be obeyed”, and I think we can use
a manual conversion to the more traditional Hollywood screenplays at first
as a way to challenge the status quo.
</p>

<p>
I can be reached as <tt>rindolf</tt> on <a href="http://freenode.net/">the
Freenode IRC network</a> in a private message or in several channels (
<tt>/whois rindolf rindolf</tt>) to further discuss the vision for
Screenplay-Text and Screenplay-XML. But I think it is a noble goal.
