“Publish or Perish” -> “Life or Death”
--------------------------------------

There's an old adage about the academia life called “Publish or Perish”
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish - wikipedia reads:

<<<
"Publish or perish" is a phrase coined to describe the pressure in academia to
rapidly and continuously publish academic work to sustain or further one's
career.[1][2][3]

Frequent publication is one of few methods at scholars' disposal to demonstrate
academic talent. Successful publications bring attention to scholars and their
sponsoring institutions, which can facilitate continued funding and an
individual's progress through their field.
>>>

Let's go a little farther from the "frequent publishing" and just into
publishing something sometime, and it is evident that a man has two choices:

1. To publish everything he or she knows and thinks in time, and be completely
honest and sincere (without lying, keeping secrets, or even speaking in
riddles, but while still keeping some privacy and using tact and wisdom.).
( = "Publish" ).

2. To keep things to himself or herself, lie, or use other forms of deceit
or camouflage, thus resulting in him isolating himself from society and
becoming paranoid. (= "Perish" ).

------------------------

If we look at history, we will see that the most enduring and surviving idea
systems were the ones that consistently published: the Greek philosophers,
the Jewish scholars, the Muslim scholars of medieval times, the
post-Renaissance/post-Printing-press Europeans, the American mass-media /
mass-publishing revolution of the 20th century, and the user-generated content
Internet of today. Yes, there always was a lot of junk
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_Law - "90% of
everything is crap"), and that includes the
very http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh (= Jewish Bible) that many people
still consider holy, but there is always a minority of good stuff.

So you should definitely publish, because keeping your "secrets" or
"core competency" for yourself is not only dishonest but a superbly
bad strategy.

The biggest offender of the “Publish or Perish → Life or Death” principle
I can think of and can relate to is the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency (NSA) and they now
face two options: either publish everything they know promptly, or perish.
