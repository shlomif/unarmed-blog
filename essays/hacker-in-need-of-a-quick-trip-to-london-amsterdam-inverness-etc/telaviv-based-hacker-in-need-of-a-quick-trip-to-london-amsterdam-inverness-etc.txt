Body of the letter:

Dear sirs and madams,

my name is Mr. Shlomi Fish and I am a writer, Internet entertainer, and amateur
philosopher, who maintains an active online presence on
http://www.shlomifish.org/ and on some user generated content and contact
information sites as http://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/ . I have become
relatively well-known and some of my features have been featured on
http://slashdot.org/ , http://freecode.com/ (formerly Freshmeat.net), on
http://reddit.com/ and on numerous blogs, microblogs, etc. Search engines
such as http://www.google.com/ or http://duckduckgo.com/ appear to love
www.shlomifish.org .

You will probably find my various creations of art and humour the most
entertaining and enlightening - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/ (including
novellas, screenplays, aphorisms, factoids about Chuck Norris/etc., shorter
“bits”, quotes, edited logs of IRC conversations, etc.) and essays such as
http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/ and
http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/advice-for-the-young/ which
some people may find even funnier than the stuff under /humour/ .

Now, I have been stuck living in Tel Aviv, Israel, for far too long and feel
like I'm getting burned out here, and need a change of scenery. As a result
I ask for the assistance of likely minded geeks, amateurs (see
http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html ), hackers (see
http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html ), polymaths and celebrities. Please quickly
spread this message up the hacker ladder, until you are a quick contact away
from the British, Dutch, etc. royal families and can request them to give
me a British/Dutch/etc. citizenship and passport, without any need for the
silly American or Israeli red tape.

This will in turn allow me to take on a much needed trip to such European
cities as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London ,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam , and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness
