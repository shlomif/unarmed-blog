Hi all,

my name is Shlomi Fish ( http://www.shlomifish.org/ ) , and speakers of
non-Hebrew languages may prefer to call me "Rindolf" (
http://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/ ) .
I hail from Ramat Aviv Gimmel ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Aviv ),
Tel Aviv ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv ),
Israel ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel ), and Tel Aviv is an awesome
city with many good restaurants and places to have fun, lots of hot girls
(and guys if that's your alley) on the street, several good universities
and colleges, very peaceful, a large military base, and all the embassies
are here too. In short the "It" city or the Alexandria of Israel.

I have written tons and tons of great stuff on my homepage -
http://www.shlomifish.org/ - but as you may know - people have never had the
energy to read anything longer than a tweet, including back when I was a child
when we only had television and radio for entertainment. And that includes
this - the Hebrew Bible - the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh - "Torah,
Nevi'im, Ktuvim". A book which I have read in part, in the original Klingon,
and which I love, despite of its many faults and things which are no longer
considered childsafe. But if you have a sparecycle, make sure to read some
of its stuff.

Anyway, like I said, no one will read anything on my homepage, and since
Reality to be conquered - must be obeyed - I have decided to film a *video*.
And to spill the beans, this video will give you some of my favourite songs
of all time, in English, Hebrew, Spanish, French, German, and some Indian
Pennisulah tongues, and I invite and encourage every awesome artist (and artists
who are not so awesome yet to cover them). Furthermore, I invite some people
who are misguided and want to wipe entire Alexandrias due to their whims, to do
the same and may life (or "publish") win over death (or "perish") -
see http://shlomifish.livejournal.com/2615.html , and we'll all live happily
ever after.

And just for the record - I am the honest-to-God motherfucking Little
Red Riding Hood of Messiahs who will bring the Baddest Apocalpyse possible.
And you are such a Messiah too, see:

OK, let's move on:

My favourite English song is “You Gotta Be” by Des'ree:

My most played English song, however, is probably “Bitch” by Meredith Brooks:

(Also see http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/Meredith%20Brooks%20-%20Bitch%20-%20_ivt_N2Zcts.flv and http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/Meredith%20Brooks%20-%20Bitch%20-%20_ivt_N2Zcts.webm )

Moving on to Hebrew.

My favourite song in Hebrew is “Shlal Sharav” (= Heat booty) as sang by Gidi
Gov:

http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/music/mp3-ogg/Gidi%20Gov%20-%20Shlal%20Sharav.mp3 )

But my most played Hebrew song is the late Shmulik Kraus’
Eykh Shegalgal Mistovev Lo (= "How the wheel turns.")
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNsiAz-XL8
(also see http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/music/mp3-ogg/Shmulik%20Kraus%20-%20Eikh%20Shegalgal%20Mistovev%20Lo.mp3 ).

And a very close second is Berry Sacharof’s “Mephaneq Maqom” (= "clearing up
space") - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj69P5rOwkQ -
