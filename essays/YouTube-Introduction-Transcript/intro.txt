Hi all,

my name is Shlomi Fish ( http://www.shlomifish.org/ ) , and speakers of
non-Hebrew languages may prefer to call me "Rindolf" (
http://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/ ) .
I hail from Ramat Aviv Gimmel ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Aviv ),
Tel Aviv ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv ),
Israel ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel ), and Tel Aviv is an awesome
city with many good restaurants and places to have fun, lots of hot girls
on the street (and guys if that's your alley), several good universities
and colleges, very peaceful, a large military base, and all the embassies
are here too. In short the "It" city or the Alexandria of Israel.

I have written tons and tons of great stuff on my homepage -
http://www.shlomifish.org/ - but as you may know - people have never had the
energy to read anything longer than a tweet, including back when I was a child
when we only had television and radio for entertainment. And that includes
this - the Hebrew Bible - the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh - "Torah,
Nevi'im, Ktuvim". A book which I have read in part, in the original Klingon,
and which I love, despite of its many faults and things which are no longer
considered child-safe. But if you have an idle moment, make sure to read
and be inspired by some of the awesome stuff there.

Anyway, like I said, no one will read anything on my homepage, and since
reality, to be conquered, must be obeyed - I have decided to film a *video*.
And to spill the beans, this video will give you some of my favourite songs
of all time, in English, Hebrew, Spanish, French, German, and some Asian Indian
tongues, and I invite and encourage every awesome artist (and artists
who are still not as awesome yet) to cover them. Furthermore, I invite some
people who are misguided and want to wipe entire Alexandrias due to their
whims, to do the same and may life (or "publish") win over death (or "perish")
- see http://shlomifish.livejournal.com/2615.html , and we'll all live happily
ever after.

And just for the record - I am the honest-to-God motherfucking Little
Red Riding Hood of Messiahs who will bring the Baddest Apocalypse possible.
And you are such a Messiah too, see:
http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/#reception .

OK, let's move on:

My favourite English song is “You Gotta Be” by Des'ree:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO40TcKa_5U .

My most played English song, however, is probably “Bitch” by Meredith Brooks:
http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=meredith%20brooks%20bitch&oq=&gs_l=

(Also see http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/Meredith%20Brooks%20-%20Bitch%20-%20_ivt_N2Zcts.flv and http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/Meredith%20Brooks%20-%20Bitch%20-%20_ivt_N2Zcts.webm )

-------------

Moving on to Hebrew.

My favourite song in Hebrew is “Shlal Sharav” (= Heat booty) as sang by Gidi
Gov:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojBKxaVL5Fw (also see
http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/music/mp3-ogg/Gidi%20Gov%20-%20Shlal%20Sharav.mp3 )

But my most played Hebrew song is the late Shmulik Kraus’
Ekh Shegalgal Mistovev Lo (= "How the wheel turns.")
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNsiAz-XL8
(also see http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/music/mp3-ogg/Shmulik%20Kraus%20-%20Eikh%20Shegalgal%20Mistovev%20Lo.mp3 ).

And a very close second is Berry Sacharof’s “Mephaneq Maqom” (= "[I am]
clearing up space"):

* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj69P5rOwkQ

* http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/Berry%20Sacharof%20-%20Mefaneh%20Maqom.flv

* http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/Berry%20Sacharof%20-%20Mefaneh%20Maqom.webm

It is a "guy-singing-to-a-girl" song because Hebrew has required genders.

And a nice "girl-singing-to-a-guy" cover of it is by Hadas Moshel:

* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2QXfNM6z8I

-------------

Moving on to Spanish.

My favourite Spanish song is Asereje by Las Ketchup, which was voted
as the worst song of the 2000-2009 decade in Israel:

* http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/music/mp3-ogg/Las%20Ketchup%20-%20Asereje.mp3

------------

Moving on to French.

My favourite French song is “Ella elle l'a” by France Gall:

* http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=france%20gall%20ella%20ella%20l%27a&oq=&gs_l=

* http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/music/mp3-ogg/France%20Gall%20-%20Ella%20elle%20l%27a.mp3

------------

Moving on to German.

I really like both:

* Nena's 99 balloons:

* * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZwhzf8NC4o

* Halt Dich An Deiner Liebe Fest by Ton Steine Scherben:

* * http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=halt%20dich%20an%20deiner%20liebe%20fest&oq=&gs_l=-

* * http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/music/mp3-ogg/07%20-%20Halt%20dich%20an%20Deiner%20Liebe%20fest.mp3

------------

Moving on to Indian songs:

My favourite is:

* Allah Ke Bande:

* * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ered22Xy4E

Now for the finale. This video is without commercials or any other annoying
stuff, and its blanket licence is the Creative Commons Attribution licence -
CC-by
- do almost what you want with it, just say that "I Was Here"
( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i41qWJ6QjPI ), and as of now I am still here,
and I am planning to remain here, hopefully indefinitely (more about
it later). However, this is something I want as an agreement among two
gentlemen (or among a gentleman and a lady), and I have much better things
to do with my time than to go and hunt down people who did not properly
attribute me. And like the great character of
http://kungfupanda.wikia.com/wiki/Po from Kung Fu Panda, or the earlier
and non-fictional character of Saladin, I don't hold
grudges against people who have violated that, because I know that “an
eye for an eye makes the whole world blind”.

Now, remember that when it comes to humans, life is the antithesis of death.
In the Bible, Yonah is disappointed that his prophecy that Ninveh the great
city did not come true, and God tells him that if he spared the life of a
nice shrub, why shouldn't he spare the life of the many inhabitants of
Ninveh?

I would really love to believe that there is an after-life and like I mention
in my screenplay Star Trek: “We, the Living Dead” (
http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/ ) that there
are guilds of conscious organisms that saves people after they die, but can
I really take a chance? Like the Hadith tells about Muhammad’s advice,
you should not leave your camel untied when you go to pray because
God helps them that helps themselves (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helps_those_who_help_themselves ). For all
I know, my death may be final, and dropping an atomic bomb on Tel Aviv or
Seoul, or San Francisco, or wherever will permanently destroy the lives of
millions of innocent, happy, productive, people who will no longer be able
to live forever - mind, body, and soul, and many of them would be Muslim,
or Koreans.

But there's another way: life. And one important aspect of life is music. So
addressing:

* The prime minister of Israel.

* The president of Iran.

* The leader of North Korea.

What are your favourite songs? Just mention them, and I want to see YouTube
and beyond filled with their awesome covers, remixes, parodies, live
performances, translations, interpretations, and in general - the voice of
life.

No, there is not going to be a contest of who gets the most views. I wasn't
the top of the class in my high school or in my B.Sc. studies in the Technion,
and I don't care, because I have a really great web site and a wonderful web
presence, and I constantly improve it and myself. Similarly,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar never won a beauty contest,
and was extremely unlikely to win one, yet because of her role playing
Buffy in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_(TV_series)
she became the "it" girl of the late 90s, and ruled the early web, supreme.
Even I was heavily infatuated with her, and she will always have a sweet spot
in my heart.

Remember, it’s always - publish or perish - if you don't share what you know
and like, then you die a little, and then a lot, and if you stop publishing,
then people will not remember you, which is worse if you say or act stupidly.
I am planning on never stopping to publish as long as I am capable of that.

And like I said, the only answer to the question "Who is the most powerful
man (or woman) on Earth?" is "I am.", and you'd better start thinking that
you are the Messiah and act like one - whether you are male or female, Jew
or non-Jew, because either you are a superheroic person or you'll end up dead.

Well, anyway, please check out my homepage - http://www.shlomifish.org/ - and
there's
a lot of short and zany stuff to read there too like
“factoids” about Chuck Norris, Larry Wall, Xena the Warrior Princess,
Buffy, and also inanimate things such as XSLT and the NSA:

* http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/

And I also have aphorisms - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html and
collections of quotes - IRC/chat conversations etc:

* http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/

I also have some blogs, a twitter feed - http://twitter.com/shlomif and
a Wiki at Wikia - http://shlomif.wikia.com/wiki/Shlomi_Fish_Wiki , which
you can fill with translations and suggestions and hacks and links and what
not.

Cheers everybody, and may life conquer death.

Best regards,

— Shlomi Fish
