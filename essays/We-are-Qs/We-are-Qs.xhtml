<h1>We are Qs!</h1>

<p>
We are Qs! Q is us! We have formed the Q continuum. And soon everyone will be
happy, shining, benevolent, unstoppable, Qs. And the New Age will finally
begin, succeeding Modernism and post-Modernism. 
</p>

<p>
So who are Qs? Read my screenplay
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star
    Trek: "We, the Living Dead"</a>, to find out. But here's a short summary:
</p>

<h2>Animals</h2>

<p>
Animals live their life without choice. They are self-controlling and alive,
but have no choice. Humans are not like that. Human are conscious, they are
sentient, they have choice.
</p>

<h2>Mortals</h2>

<p>
Mortals are everyday humans. They can be very bad or very good or somewhere
between that. But they are still mortals and their psyche may die, living them
as dead human beings. As people with psyche death, they become resentful and
less and less capable, and more envious and eventually bad, mystical people,
who are parasites and try to suck life out of the living. Sometimes they 
succeed, but often they don't because mortals and especially vampires (see
below) know better.
</p>

<h2>Vampires</h2>

<p>
Vampires are mortals who have determined to stay young forever (at least
in their heart), to keep a live and healthy psyche and to enjoy life, more
and more no matter what happens to them.  
</p>

<h2>Rings</h2>

<p>
Rings are supreme vampires. Not only are they vampires, but they are very
influential and turn all those around them into vampires, and can see through
irrationality and illogicality . Even if they are not violent, they
cannot lose and cannot be stopped.
</p>

<p>
There were nine (9) most notable rings in human history:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Moses - The Jew</li>
<li>Cyrus - The Liberator</li>
<li>Aristotle - The Objective</li>
<li>Muhammad - The Messenger</li>
<li>Saladin - The Just</li>
<li>Gutenberg - The Printer</li>
<li>Galileo - The Scientist</li>
<li>George Washington - The Liberal</li>
<li>Ayn Rand - The Objectivist</li>
</ol>

<p>
Ayn Rand's legacy was that many people who have read her words (or better,
learned from her deeds) became rings themselves. So there was no use in 
keeping track of more. But what's missing?
</p>

<h2>Q - The Invisible</h2>

<p>
Q is the one ring of the lord of darkness (= the Q continuum). Even if he's
fictional and imaginary, he is alive - he lives in our soul. Q's legacy was
that he jumpstarted what is now one of the universe's most advanced 
civilisations, while still not being omnipotent (which is a logical
and mathematical impossibility), and still starting off as a mortal. What
made Q extraordinary, is that he was a ring who expected anyone else to be
rings. Not only that, but he expected everyone else to become Qs and thus
to infinity.
</p>

<p>
Q is not someone else. We don't have to go afar to seek the holy grail. Q is
us. We are Q. We will ascend from mortals to vampires to rings to Qs. We
will be invincible, and no one will be able to stop us.
</p>

<h2>Who are the Qs of today?</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Peter_Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a> (a
great ring of the past) once said that “If Botticelli were alive today he'd be 
working for Vogue”. Back when he said that, Vogue was more subversive and
avant-garde and was considered a culture of low taste. Nowadays, Vogue is
more established, and many intelligent women and men will boast writing
for it in their bio or resume. The same goes for Playboy, BTW.
</p>

<p>
So if an artist as avantgarde and as controversial as Ayn Rand lived today
who will she be? No, she will not be on Flickr, which is great as it is, is 
not too subversive. She will likely be someone like 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Christina Grimmie</a>.
Ms. Grimmie may only be a vampirella, but if she is determined, she too 
can become a ring and a Q and so can you.
