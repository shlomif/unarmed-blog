<h1>Blog Entry for my 36th Birthday (Take 2)</h1>

<p>
Being born on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_5">5 May</a>
1977, I turn 36 (= thirty six) on 5 May 2013. 36 is a special number for me
in part because it is the square of 6, but more importantly because it is
two times of 18. The age of 18 is considered the start of maturity in Israel
when Israeli boys and girls gain the right to vote, and are supposed to enroll
into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces">the
Israeli military</a>, and normally hit sexual maturity at that point.
The time I was 18, 19, 20 in 1995-1997, was very influential for me, and
now I feel that I have achieved a second maturity.
</p>

<p>
I feel I have finally reached peace of mind, am enjoying all the little
things in life, and can honestly see reality as it is, and see through many
lies. Part of my problem was that for a long time I was
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#playing_the_invisible">playing
the “Invisible”</a>, which is something I decided to avoid from now on and
work on better publicity. A different issue was me thinking of myself
as <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/">The
Eternal Jew</a>, i.e: a profile, or a “god” in the stock exchange of the
Gods, which was an unhealthy tendency that I finally put to rest
in <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#from-dispeller-to-selina">a scene</a> of my screenplay,
<i>Selina Mandrake - The Slayer</i> (thanks to the wonderful protagonist
there). Finally, yet another problem was that I have not
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#not_accept_who_I_am">accepted
who I am</a>, which is also something that I decided to avoid from now.
</p>

<p>
If I were ever going to visit
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverending_Story">Fantastica</a>,
the land of imagination, I would need to be very careful from the wrath
of the characters of <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">my
stories and screenplays</a>, whom I have put to much suffering (but at least
all of them, with an exception in
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/"><i>The
Enemy and How I Helped to Fight it</i></a>, ended up alive at the end of
the stories and happier than ever.). However, all this suffering was secondary
to my own which involved
<a
href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/hypomanias/">hypomanias</a>, and even some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania">Manias</a>, which
caused some deteriorated health, and unhappiness to my surrounding.
</p>

<p>
I have decided that from now on, I would like to socialise more, which I
was told and understood was part of what is causing hypomanias and the
underlying reason behind
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Bipolar disorder</a>.
I have already attended one
<a href="http://www.olamot-con.org.il/2013/">Science Fiction and Fantasy
Conference</a> in Tel Aviv, and it was a great and colourful experience,
and also proved a catalyst for coming up with the idea of
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">a
screenplay I have written</a>. I want to do stuff like that more often
which will hopefully mitigate my hypomanias problem.
