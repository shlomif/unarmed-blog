I'm maintaining this blog in Live Journal under unarmed.shlomifish.org and pay
them 25 USD yearly, because frankly 25 USD per year is a bargain for all the
work I'll have to do to bring
<a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/catable">Catable</a> to a usable state,
where Catable is the blog engine by some
other busy hackers, written from scratch by inspiration from
<a href="http://www.catonmat.net/">Peteris</a>, who said that every hacker
should write their own custom blog engine (and which he did). In any case,
until Catable or some other blog engine will be usable enough, I cannot
halt my other plans for "world domination" as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>
put it. (Not to mention that paying 25 dollars a year may well
be worth the hassle and time spent in maintaining a complex piece of
server-side code on my own hosting's servers.)
