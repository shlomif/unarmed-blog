<h2>2010-12-20: Welcome to "Unarmed but still Dangerous"</h2>

<p>
Hi, everyone! "Unarmed but still dangerous" (subtitled "Changing the world
, one post at a time) aims at providing insights about applied philosophy
that one may even find useful at times, from the perspective of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28programmer_subculture%29">computer 
software and media enthusiasts</a>, who enjoy writing software applications,
articles, essays, works of fiction, images, pictures and photos, music and 
sounds, videos, games, and/or works of science or technology. In short:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28programmer_subculture%29">"hackers"</a> (not necessarily computer intruders, though the more honest, 
"white-hat" ones are also encouraged to read this blog), be it of software, or 
of anything from cooking up to rocket science. What you will find here is an 
attempt to expand the intelligence, wisdom, and insights gathered from hacking 
on stuff to other fields, whether of software, of human-to-human or
human-to-machine interactions, or anything that can prove of use.
</p>

<p>
The name "Unarmed but still Dangerous" is as a homage and parody on 
<a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/">Eric S. 
Raymond's blog "Armed and Dangerous"</a>, which I don't follow nor read 
regularly, but does provide some insights at times (or leads one to better
insights). I should note that I am very fond of a lot of the stuff on
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Raymond's old homepage</a>, especially
his <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">"How to Become
a Hacker" document</a>, and his 
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">"Cathedral and 
the Bazaar" series</a>.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I've published 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/hypomanias/">a new
essay I've written titled "Dealing with Hypomanias"</a> on my homepage. I've
been suffering from periods of bad pyschological moods since I was 14 years
old, including clinical depressions, clincial anxities, hypomanias (= 
"below-manias") and even some manias. As a result, I believe I have 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Bipolar disorder</a>,
but the psychotherapist I go to said he didn't diagnose me as such, because
doing so will have no implication on my therapy.
</p>

<p>
Lately, I've mostly only had hypomanias, and this essay gives some advice from
my experience on how to effectively handle them. I'd appreciate any feedback.
