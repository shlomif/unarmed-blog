<h2>2010-12-20: Welcome to "Unarmed but still Dangerous"</h2>

<p>
Hi, everyone! "Unarmed but still dangerous" (subtitled "Changing the world
, one post at a time) aims at providing insights about applied philosophy
that one may even find useful at times, from the perspective of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28programmer_subculture%29">computer 
software and media enthusiasts</a>, who enjoy writing software applications,
articles, essays, works of fiction, images, pictures and photos, music and 
sounds, videos, games, and/or works of science or technology. In short:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28programmer_subculture%29">"hackers"</a> (not necessarily computer intruders, though the more honest, 
"white-hat" ones are also encouraged to read this blog), be it of software, or 
of anything from cooking up to rocket science. What you will find here is an 
attempt to expand the intelligence, wisdom, and insights gathered from hacking 
on stuff to other fields, whether of software, of human-to-human or
human-to-machine interactions, or anything that can prove of use.
</p>

<p>
The name "Unarmed but still Dangerous" is as a homage and parody on 
<a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/">Eric S. 
Raymond's blog "Armed and Dangerous"</a>, which I don't follow nor read 
regularly, but does provide some insights at times (or leads one to better
insights). I should note that I am very fond of a lot of the stuff on
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Raymond's old homepage</a>, especially
his <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">"How to Become
a Hacker" document</a>, and his 
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">"Cathedral and 
the Bazaar" series</a>.
</p>

<p>
My name is Shlomi Fish, I'm an Israeli software developer, essayist and 
writer, and have kept several 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/blogs/">several blogs</a> on various
topics, both technical and philosophical/personal, and 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">an 
actively updated and enhanced personal web-site</a>, which contains many
original online resources, including humorous novellas, screenplays, 
smaller-scope stories and quotes, some mathematical riddles and puzzles,
many essays, articles, and other software resources, and some open-source
programs and applications I've written. So why this blog? Well, I've figured
out that my old <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal blog</a>
was too unfocused and I also ran out of Technorati-like tags there, due to
using many tags at once, and because I'd like a clean start. I love my home
site, and it brings me a lot of joy to maintain it and hear from people
who liked it, but being a static HTML web-site (although generated
using a complex offline content management system), it lacks comments and
I would also prefer to maintain it as an old-fashioned homepage (remember
those) instead of convert it to a new-style all-in-one CMS with comments
, where I'll have to constantly deal with comments, both good and annoying,
and abuse.
</p>

<p>
I'm maintaing this blog in Live Journal under unarmed.shlomifish.org and pay
them 25 USD yearly, because frankly 25 USD per year is a bargain for all the 
work I'll have to do to bring
<a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/catable">Catable</a> to a usable state, 
where catable is the blog engine by some
other busy hackers, written from scratch by inspiration from 
<a href="http://www.catonmat.net/">Peteris</a>, who said that every hacker
should write their own custom blog engine (and which he did). In any case,
until Catable or some other blog engine will be usable enough, I cannot
halt my other plans for "world domination" as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>
put it. (Not to mention that paying 25 dollars a year may well 
be worth the hassle and time spent in maintaining a complex piece of
server-side code on my own hosting's servers.)
