<h2>2010-12-20: Welcome to "Unarmed but still Dangerous"</h2>

<p>
Hi, everyone! "Unarmed but still dangerous" (subtitled "Changing the world
one post at a time") aims at providing insights about applied philosophy that
one may even find useful at times, from the perspective of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28programmer_subculture%29">computer
software and media enthusiasts</a>, who enjoy writing software applications,
articles, essays, works of fiction, images, pictures and photos, music and
sounds, videos, games, and/or works of science or technology. In short: <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28programmer_subculture%29">"hackers"</a>
(not necessarily computer intruders, though the more honest, "white-hat" ones
are also encouraged to read this blog), be it of software, or of anything from
cooking up to rocket science. What you will find here is an attempt to expand
the intelligence, wisdom, and insights gathered from hacking on stuff to other
fields, including software, of human-to-human or human-to-machine interactions.
</p>

<p>
The name "Unarmed but still Dangerous" is as a homage and parody on 
<a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/">Eric S. 
Raymond's blog "Armed and Dangerous"</a>, which I neither follow nor read 
regularly, but which does provide some insights at times (or leads one to 
better insights). I should note that I am very fond of a lot of the stuff on
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Raymond's old homepage</a>, especially
his <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">"How to Become
a Hacker" document</a>, and his 
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">"The Cathedral
and the Bazaar" series</a>.
</p>

<p>
My name is Shlomi Fish, I'm an Israeli open source and open content
enthusiast. I have kept 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/blogs/">several blogs</a> on various
topics, both technical and philosophical/personal, and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">an 
actively updated and enhanced personal web-site</a>, which contains many
original online resources, including fiction, presentation material, 
mathematics, essays and software resources.
</p>

<p>
One myth that I'd like to help dispel in this blog is that philosophy is
not practical. The first fact to note is that the ancient Greek called all
scholars "philosophers", and that they often dealt in many fields
of scholarship that we now consider more sciency. This is still preserved in 
the expansion of a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> - 
"Doctor of Philosophy". Often philosophy and philosophy as applied to
different fields can lead one to detect common errors as they are done, avoid
bad situations, and win arguments. I am philosophising now and you 
philosophise all the time.
</p>

<p>
The main audience of this blog are what 
<a href="http://blog.red-bean.com/sussman/?p=79">Ben Collins-Sussman (of
Subversion fame) calls the "20% of programmers"</a> - the alpha programmers,
those who love programming, are constantly expanding their horizons, spend
a lot of time hanging on various online and offline forums for geeks (including
mailing lists, IRC (Internet Relay Chat), Slashdot, Reddit/Digg, various
blogs, various open-source clubs), often have their own blog, and who are
otherwise brighter and more intelligent (not necessarily in the IQ sense,
which does not say a lot of one's mental potential for growth and success). 
Hopefully, it may also be of interest to geeks of other fields of endeavours
who are still computer savvy enough to read and follow a blog.
